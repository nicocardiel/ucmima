Installation
============

Requirements
------------

**ucmima** is written in Fortran 77 and it has been developed in a linux
machine. The installation procedure should be trivial for most users. The only
requirement is to have a relatively recent linux distribution, including a
fortran compiler (e.g. ``g77`` or ``gfortran``) and the GNU ``autotools``.

Before you install **ucmima**, make sure that the graphical library ``PGPLOT``
and the library ``CFITSIO`` are already installed in your computer. Some details about how I do typically
install these library are given `here for PGPLOT
<https://guaix.fis.ucm.es/~ncl/howto/howto-pgplot>`_, and
`here for CFITSIO
<https://guaix.fis.ucm.es/~ncl/howto/howto-cfitsio>`_.


Installation of **ucmima**
--------------------------

To install **ucmima** you need to perform the following steps:

1.- Download the latest version of the code from github:

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/nicocardiel/ucmima

2.- Install the program by executing:

::

   $ cd ucmima
   $ autoreconf -i -s -f
   $ ./configure

.. note:: Mac users can easily indicate a different Fortran compiler using, for
   example: 

   ``./configure F77=gfortran-mp-5``.

3.- After successfully executing configure, the system is ready to proceed with
the actual compilation of the code:

::

   $ make

If you get an error installing the software, check that the fortran compiler
you are using to install ``PGPLOT`` and to compile **ucmima** is the same. If
this is not the case, force the compiler to be the same by indicating it when
executing configure with the help of the paramter ``F77``. For example, if
``PGPLOT`` was installed using the g95 compiler, execute:

::

   $ make clean
   $ ./configure F77=g95  NXMAX=4300 NYMAX=4300
   $ make

Note that in the configure instruction we are also defining ``NXMAX`` and
``NYMAX``, the maximum allowed dimensions of the FITS images.


Mac users typically will need something like:

::

   $ make clean
   $ ./configure F77=gfortran-mp-13 CC=gcc-mp-13
   $ make

4.- Finally, you must finish the installation procedure by placing the
executable file in its corresponding directory. If you are
installing the software in the by default directory (``/usr/local/...``), you
need root privileges:

::

   $ sudo make install

or

::

   $ su
   # make install

5.- You can optionally clean the intermediate object files generated during the
compilation procedure:

::

   $ make clean
